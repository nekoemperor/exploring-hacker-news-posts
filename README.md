## About:
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

## Introduction:
Dataset has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.

## Goals:
We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either: 
* "Ask HN" or 
* "Show HN" 
Users submit "Ask HN" posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
